# A Full-Stack, Self-Contained Shopping Demo App With Svelte, Golang and SQLite

![ezgif-5-22d3d39425](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44191076/148008744-14f89c9d-5343-483a-8bdc-c05618a84acc.gif)

This is a simple shopping demo app, based on the same Angular/React/Vue.js examples in <i>[Essential Typescript](https://github.com/Apress/essential-typescript-4)</i> by Adam Freeman:

- Front-end: (`/src`)
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - Component framework: [Svelte 4](https://svelte.dev/)
  - Application framework: [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
  - Static site generation: [@sveltejs/adapter-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sveltejs/adapter-static)
  - CSS styles: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Back-end: (`/backend`)
  - [Golang](https://go.dev/)
  - Static web server/web services: [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
  - SQLite driver: [go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)
- Database: (`/db`)
  - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

The project has a Dockerfile that creates a single container with multi-stage builds (image size less than 30 MB) and also supports to be opened in DevContainer/CodeSpace.

The Svelte app has the following routes:

| Route           | Page                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/`             | (Redirect to `/products`)                |
| `/products`     | Browse and add products to shopping cart |
| `/order`        | View and checkout order                  |
| `/summary/{id}` | Order result                             |

> SvelteKit has a feature to create ["backend APIs"](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server), and I guess you would be able to call Node-based database packages from there if the production is built by `@sveltejs/adapter-node` and run in a Node environment. However the Golang server here is enough - and smaller too - so we don't really need to create duplicated APIs.

The backend creates two RESTful-like APIs:

| API                 | Function                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| GET `/api/products` | Query and retur product data             |
| POST `/api/orders`  | Write order data and return new order ID |

Adam Freeman's original projects use `json-server` on an Express server as mock API services. I keep the spec of the services for the sake of demonstration. Right now, like all the original examples, the app only reads product lists and write order data. The `Axios` package used in the original examples is also replaced with `fetch`.

The purpose of project is an experiment to build a small, modern and self-contained full-stack monolithic application, but it is not meant to be a practical template for any real world applications. Error handlings are ignored in this project.

A similar version using Vue.js, Express, MongoDB and Docker Compose [can be found here](https://github.com/alankrantas/vueapp-typescript-express) (no longer maintained).

## Setup Local Project

For local development you'll need

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (for dev or production)
- [Golang](https://go.dev/dl/) (for production)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (only required for generating the container)

> If you are Windows user the `go-sqlite3` package requires GCC to compile, which can be installed with [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) (choose `MinGW32-base`, `MinGW32-gcc-g++` and `MinGW32-gcc-objc` package, then add `\MinGW\bin` to `$PATH`). On Linux you can installing the package `build-essential`.

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alankrantas/svelteapp-typescript-go.git
cd svelteapp-typescript-go
```

### Serve in Dev Mode

Run the Svelte app in development mode. The app _will not_ call any backend APIs, instead it returns mock product data and the returned order number is always `42`.

```bash
npm run setup
npm run dev
```

The app will be open at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build and Serve Production

Install dependencies, build both front-end and back-end apps and run the local server:

```bash
npm run setup-all
npm run build-all
npm run serve
```

The app would open at `http://localhost:8080`.

> On Windows use `npm run serve-win` instead since NPM uses CMD to run bash scripts.

### Upgrade All Dependencies

```bash
npm run upgrade-all
```

> Use `npm run upgrade` to upgrade only the front-end dependencies.

---

### Build and Run as a Docker Container

```bash
npm run docker
npm run docker-run
```

The app would open at `http://localhost:8080`.

## SQLite DB Schemes and Test Data

The database (`./db/data.sqlite3`) in this repo already contains the table `products` with 9 product records (which can be found in many Adam Freeman's books) and an empty table `orders`. You can use [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to read the database.

Here's the SQL statements to recreate them:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "products" (
	"id"	INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	"name"	TEXT NOT NULL,
	"category"	TEXT NOT NULL,
	"description"	TEXT,
	"price"	REAL NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY("id" AUTOINCREMENT)
);

CREATE TABLE "orders" (
	"id"	INTEGER NOT NULL,
	"product_id"	INTEGER NOT NULL,
	"quantity"	INTEGER NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO "main"."products" (
	"id",
	"name",
	"category",
	"description",
	"price"
)
VALUES
	('1', 'Kayak', 'Watersports', 'A boat for one person', '275.0'),
	('2', 'Lifejacket', 'Watersports', 'Protective and fashionable', '48.95'),
	('3', 'Soccer Ball', 'Soccer', 'FIFA-approved size and weight', '19.5'),
	('4', 'Corner Flags', 'Soccer', 'Give your playing field a professional touch', '34.95'),
	('5', 'Stadium', 'Soccer', 'Flat-packed 35,000-seat stadium', '79500.0'),
	('6', 'Thinking Cap', 'Chess', 'Improve brain efficiency by 75%', '16.0'),
	('7', 'Unsteady Chair', 'Chess', 'Secretly give your opponent a disadvantage', '29.95'),
	('8', 'Human Chess Board', 'Chess', 'A fun game for the family', '75.0'),
	('9', 'Bling Bling King', 'Chess', 'Gold-plated, diamond-studded King', '1200.0');
```
